// HTTPRequest holds a fully parsed HTTP request.

// Memory layout — two independent allocations, both Go-managed:
//
//  1. req.owned  — a copy of the raw header bytes (data[:headerEnd]).
//     req.Path and all req.Header keys/values are unsafe string views
//     (b2s slices) into this allocation. The GC keeps owned alive as
//     long as any of those strings are reachable, even after *HTTPRequest
//     itself is collected. Handlers may safely stash header strings in
//     globals or caches without copying them.
//
//  2. OnTraffic's reassembly buf — a Go-owned []byte built by appending
//     gnet's read buffer into an existing slice. req.Body is a zero-copy
//     subslice of this allocation. The GC keeps the backing array alive
//     as long as req.Body is reachable.
//
// Neither allocation is shared with gnet's internal ring buffer or with
// the per-connection leftover slice stored in s.bufs. OnTraffic is free
// to compact or discard s.bufs at any time without affecting an
// in-flight handler's view of req.Path, req.Header, or req.Body.
//
// req.Method is either a package-level constant (no allocation) or a
// freshly copied string for unknown methods — it does not point into owned.
