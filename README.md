# Breeze

> **A ridiculously fast, event-driven Go web framework built for maximum
> throughput, minimal allocations, native WebSockets, and
> production-ready APIs.**

Breeze is a modern, high-performance Go web framework engineered for
developers who demand speed without sacrificing developer experience.
Built on an event-driven architecture, Breeze minimizes allocations,
optimizes every request path, and provides first-class support for REST
APIs, WebSockets, middleware, and automatic OpenAPI documentation.

Whether you're building microservices, real-time applications, or
high-throughput APIs, Breeze is designed to handle millions of requests
efficiently while keeping your code clean and maintainable.
