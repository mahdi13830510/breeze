Breeze is a modern, high-performance Go web framework engineered for
developers who demand speed without sacrificing developer experience.
Built on an event-driven architecture, Breeze minimizes allocations,
optimizes every request path, and provides first-class support for REST
APIs, WebSockets, middleware, and automatic OpenAPI documentation.

Whether you're building microservices, real-time applications, or
high-throughput APIs, Breeze is designed to handle millions of requests
efficiently while keeping your code clean and maintainable.

## Installation

Requires **Go 1.24.3** or later.

```bash
go get github.com/nelthaarion/breeze
```

The module pulls in **gnet v2** for the event loop, **go-json** for fast
JSON marshaling, **brotli** for compression, and **golang-jwt/jwt** for
authentication.

📖 **Full documentation:** <https://nelthaarion.github.io/breeze>

## Quick Start

A complete working server in under 20 lines:

```go
package main

import (
    "runtime"

    "github.com/nelthaarion/breeze"
    middleware "github.com/nelthaarion/breeze/middlewares"
)

func main() {
    router := breeze.NewRouter()

    router.Use(middleware.RecoveryMiddleware())
    router.Use(middleware.LoggingMiddleware())

    router.Handle(breeze.GET, "/", func(ctx *breeze.Context) {
        ctx.JSON(map[string]string{"status": "ok"})
    })

    router.Handle(breeze.GET, "/users/:id", func(ctx *breeze.Context) {
        ctx.JSON(map[string]string{"id": ctx.Param("id")})
    })

    pool := breeze.NewWorkerPool(runtime.NumCPU())
    app  := breeze.New(router, pool)
    app.Run(3000, true) // port, multiCore
}
```

Run it:

```bash
go run main.go
# → curl http://localhost:3000/        → {"status":"ok"}
# → curl http://localhost:3000/users/42 → {"id":"42"}
```

## 🧰 CLI — Scaffolding & Code Generation

Breeze ships a `rails`-style CLI for scaffolding projects and generating
CRUD boilerplate.

```bash
go install github.com/nelthaarion/breeze/cmd/breeze@latest
```

**Start a new project:**

```bash
breeze new myapp                    # minimal REST API layout (default)
breeze new myapp --template=views   # + views/components/template engine
```

**Generate a full CRUD resource** — structs, handlers, an in-memory store,
and OpenAPI docs, wired into the router automatically:

```bash
breeze generate resource User name:string email:string age:int
```

**Generate a bare handler stub** (no structs, no docs):

```bash
breeze generate handler Session --methods=get,create
```

Both generators write to `handlers/<name>.go` and register routes in a
single `routes_generated.go` file — your hand-written `main.go` is never
touched. Re-running `generate` for the same resource replaces its block,
so it's safe to regenerate after adding fields (pass `--force` to overwrite
the handler file too).

Supported field types: `string`, `int`, `int64`, `float64`, `bool`, `time.Time`.
